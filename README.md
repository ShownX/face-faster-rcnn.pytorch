# Face Detection based on *Faster* Pytorch Implementation of Faster R-CNN

## Introduction
Add WIDER Face dataset to Faster-RCNN model to train a face detection

* Faster RCNN based on [JWYang's implementation](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch)

## Setup
1. Setup Faster RCNN following instruction on [JWYang's implementation](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch)
2. Download [WIDER Face dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/) and extract to **data** folder as below structure
   * data
     * WIDER2015
       * eval_tools
       * wider_face_split
       * WIDER_test
       * WIDER_train
       * WIDER_val
